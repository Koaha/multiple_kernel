**Suggested Feature Enhancements for Multiple Kernel SVM Library**

**1\. Enhanced Data Preprocessing Utilities**

- **Standardized Preprocessing**: Add data normalization and scaling options in utilities/helpers.py, which can be used directly in the SVMWrapper class to standardize data.
- **Automatic Feature Selection**: Implement a basic feature selection method to remove irrelevant or redundant features, potentially reducing computation time and improving model performance.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Add options to handle missing data by filling in mean/median values or performing forward filling, useful for real-world datasets.

**2\. Support for Additional Kernels**

- **String Kernel**: Useful for text-based SVM applications, where similarity between sequences can be measured.
- **Sigmoid Kernel**: Often used in neural networks, providing another non-linear option.
- **Wavelet Kernel**: Could be useful for time series or signal processing applications.
- **Custom Kernel Interface**: Expand the Custom kernel class in kernels/kernels.py to make it easier for users to plug in any custom kernel function dynamically.

**3\. Integrated Hyperparameter Tuning**

- Add a **hyperparameter optimization module** in utilities that uses techniques like grid search or random search to automatically optimize C, kernel parameters, or solver-specific parameters.
- For a more advanced setup, integrate with optuna or scikit-optimize for automated tuning with minimal code adjustments.

**4\. Ensemble and Stacking Capabilities**

- **Ensemble of SVMs**: Implement a new class in trees that trains multiple SVMs with different kernels and combines their predictions. This would make the library more robust in handling complex data with mixed feature types.
- **Kernel Stacking**: Use a stacking approach with different kernel types as separate layers. Users could apply different SVMs with various kernels on subsets of the data and stack predictions for a final classifier.

**5\. Real-time Model Evaluation Metrics**

- Include real-time metrics tracking for models with online solvers (LaSVM, NySVM). For example, tracking accuracy or margin violation counts after each batch update.
- Include a utility to visualize model metrics over time, showing how the model evolves during online training.

**6\. Cross-Validation and Evaluation Metrics Module**

- Add a **cross-validation helper** in utilities/helpers.py to split data automatically and perform K-fold cross-validation. Integrate this into SVMWrapper to make evaluating models more convenient.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provide detailed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This module could be integrated into utilities/helpers.py for reuse.

**7\. Automatic Model Saving and Loading**

- In SVMWrapper, add functionality to **save and load trained models** as serialized objects. This is especially useful for NySVM and LaSVM solvers where training could be computationally expensive.

**8\. Enhanced Visualization Module**

- Add a new visualization module to visualize decision boundaries, margins, and support vectors, especially for 2D datasets. This is useful for understanding how different kernels and solvers perform.
- **Tree Structure Visualization**: In the trees/tree_constructor.py, add visualization for kernel composition trees, making it easy for users to understand the combinations generated.

**9\. Parameter Logging and Experiment Tracking**

- Include a logging feature for tracking parameters, kernel choices, and performance metrics in each experiment, useful for reproducibility.
- For advanced tracking, integrate with MLflow or Weights and Biases to save experiment results, parameter values, and metrics.

**10\. Modular Callback System**

- Implement a callback system for custom actions during training. For instance, users could pass callback functions to handle events like batch processing, convergence checking, or result saving. This would make the library more flexible, especially for online learning solvers.

**11\. Documentation and Examples**

- Add extensive documentation, including:
  - Code usage examples for each component.
  - Detailed explanation of kernel choices and how different solvers handle them.
  - Common use cases with sample code (e.g., online learning, Nystr√∂m approximation).
- **Example Notebooks**: Create Jupyter notebooks demonstrating use cases like standard SVM training, kernel chaining, online learning, and hyperparameter tuning, making it easier for new users to understand the library's capabilities.

**12\. GPU Acceleration (Future)**

- If computationally intensive operations become a bottleneck, consider adding GPU support with CuPy or PyTorch, especially for kernel computations and large matrix operations.
